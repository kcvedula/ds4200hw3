# Welcome to My Website!


## Short introduction 
Hello. Welcome to a website where I talk about my childhood dog. His name was Arya. He was awesome. I got him when I was ten. My family and I went on a road trip to Missouri to pick him up. We arrived at the breeder to see his dad in a fence, barking at us. His dad was basically a guard dog. His grandparents greeted us right before we went inside the house. They were super nice, and licked my entire arm. We met Arya with his siblings. They were all seven weeks old, very soft, fluffy, and sweet. Arya weighed fifteen pounds when we got him. 

In six months, he weighed ninety pounds, thirty more than I was. He grew up so quickly. First, his ears started pointing up. He became more energetic, hungrier, and started exploring more outside. He was very fun to run around with. A common game to play with one’s dog is fetch, but Arya never liked fetch. Instead, if we were bored, we wrestled or played tag. 

He grew to his full size, I think briefly passing 100 lbs. After the first two years of his life, he mellowed out. He spent most of his day sleeping, waiting for the next meal. He also got a lot closer to my dad and didn’t show much emotion until my dad came home. He became very protective of our home, just like his dad. He stayed like that for the rest of his life. I didn’t mind it much, because at that point, I was starting high school and becoming a lot more busy and independent as well. Every now and then though, when I came home, he would jump on me and show a lot of attention, which made me very happy.
